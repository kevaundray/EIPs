## Abstract

This proposal specifies hardware and bandwidth recommendations for different types of Ethereum nodes:

- **Full nodes**: Nodes that follow the tip of the chain without necessarily proposing blocks.
- **Validators**: Split into:
  - **Attesters**: Validators that validate and attest to blocks created by proposers.
  - **Proposers**: Validators that create blocks using either a local execution layer client or an external block builder and broadcast them to the network.

We note that it may be possible to run a client with less than the recommended specifications, however benchmarks and decision-making will be made with respect to these recommendations.

## Motivation

Clear system specifications are crucial for:

- Ensuring meaningful benchmark comparisons across different client implementations.
- Enabling informed decision-making about protocol upgrades and their resource usage implications.
- Providing clear guidance for node operators to ensure alignment with future network requirements.

Without a shared understanding of target hardware specifications:

- Benchmark results lose significance due to inconsistent testing environments.
- Decision-making becomes challenging for implementation choices, as performance characteristics are heavily hardware-dependent.
- Network participants lack clear guidance for hardware investments.

## Specification

### Roles and Their Recommended Specifications

Node operators typically run both an **Execution Layer (EL)** client and a **Consensus Layer (CL)** client on the same machine. The specifications below assume the combined resource usage of both.

| Node Type                                   | Storage   | Memory | CPU Cores / Threads | **PassMark CPU Rating** | Bandwidth Download / Upload |
| --------------------------------------------| --------- | ------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Full Node**                               | 4 TB NVMe | 32 GB  | 4c / 8t             | ~1000 ST / 3000 MT      | 50 Mbps / 15 Mbps           |
| **Attester**                                | 4 TB NVMe | 64 GB  | 8c / 16t            | ~3500 ST / 25000 MT     | 50 Mbps / 25 Mbps           |
| **Proposer (Local Execution Layer client)** | 4 TB NVMe | 64 GB  | 8c / 16t            | ~3500 ST / 25000 MT     | 100 Mbps / 50 Mbps          |
| **Proposer (External Builder)**             | 4 TB NVMe | 64 GB  | 8c / 16t            | ~3500 ST / 25000 MT     | 100 Mbps / 50 Mbps          |

*Approximate single-thread (ST) and multi-thread (MT) PassMark CPU scores. For example, a PassMark ST rating of 3500 and an MT rating of 25000 typically corresponds to upper mid-range server CPUs circa 2024–2025.*

## Rationale

### Storage

- **Recommended**: 4 TB NVMe M.2 drive with:
  - **Sequential R/W**: 7,000 MB/s
  - **Random 4K R/W**: Up to 1,000,000 IOPS
- **Why NVMe over SATA?**
  - NVMe drives have significantly higher throughput and lower latency than SATA SSDs.  
  - Drives without DRAM (DRAMless) or with QLC flash are not advised, due to lower endurance and potentially lower sustained performance.
- **On Endurance (TBW)**  
  - Running a node involves frequent writes (e.g., database updates, logs). Ensure that the SSD’s Total Bytes Written (TBW) rating is sufficient for multi-year operation.
- **Capacity Considerations**  
  - As of January 2025, 2 TB can still work, but daily chain growth makes 4 TB more future-proof.  
  - While EIP-4444 aims to reduce historical storage requirements, the timeline for EIP-4444 remains uncertain.

### Memory

- **Why 64 GB for Validators (Attester / Local Block Builder)?**
  - Running an Ethereum validator (both EL & CL clients) can be memory-intensive, with state cache dominating RAM usage.
  - Certain memory intensive client combinations have historically failed with 16 GB.  
  - Preliminary benchmarks (e.g., [zk-STARK memory usage](https://hackmd.io/@han/bench-hash-in-snark)) suggest cryptographic operations can demand significant RAM.
  - Relative to total hardware costs, upgrading from 32 GB to 64 GB is a small price but can improve stability and is more future proof with regards to zk-STARKS.

### CPU

- **Single vs. Multi-thread Performance**
  - Attesters and local block builders benefit from both high single-thread and solid multi-thread performance.

### Bandwidth

#### Proposer

##### Blocks built using a local execution layer client

- **Recommended**: 100 Mbps download, 50 Mbps upload.
- **Rationale**:  
  - Distributing blocks is highly bandwidth-intensive as it's important to broadcast to as many peers in as short time as possible for attesters to attest to the block in time.
  - If a builder cannot meet these speeds, they risk slower propagation and causing late blocks.
  - In extreme cases, a low-bandwidth node could propose partially full blocks or one that includes fewer blobs to mitigate slow broadcast.

##### Blocks built using an external builder

- **Recommended**: 50 Mbps download / 25 Mbps upload.
- **Rationale**:
  - Most MEV-relay interactions involve connecting to a relay and fetching bundles and block headers, which can be done within typical broadband speeds.
  - While the local validator will still share the block with its peers, the relay will do the same which reduces the need for local bandwidth.
  - However, there may be cases where your validator will still build a local block, such as if no MEV-relay responds or if the value of the MEV reward is lower than the minimum configuration set in MEV-Boost. In these circumstances, the recommendations for **Local Block Builders** would be relevant.

#### Attesters

- **Recommended**: 50 Mbps download, 25 Mbps upload.
- **Minimum tested**: 15 Mbps (as per [ethPandaOps](https://ethpandaops.io/) simulations where 40% of the network had Gigabit connections and the other 60% had 15 Mbps upload).
  - However, real-world performance depends on peer network topology. A node with poor bandwidth could in theory quickly share data with a well-connected peer with good bandwidth which means that this peer could quickly seed the network.
- **Rationale**:
  - 25 Mbps was chosen as a buffer to account for these miscellaneous factors that are harder to predict.

#### Full Nodes

- **Recommended**: 50 Mbps download / 15 Mbps upload.
- **Rationale**:
  - Full nodes currently participate in sampling and must track the chain tip, but are not as latency-sensitive as attesters or local block builders.
  - They can operate on lower bandwidth but risk being a slot or more behind the chain if bandwidth capacity is severely limited.
